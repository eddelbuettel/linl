### Motivation

The LaTeX Letter class is very useful for simple letters.  As such
letters are also somewhat standardized, they make for excellent
candidates for use by Markdown.

This package leans on earlier work by [Aaron Wolen](https://www.aaronwolen.com/) in his
[pandoc-letter](https://github.com/aaronwolen/pandoc-letter) repository, and extends it for use from
R via the [rmarkdown](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rmarkdown) package.

### Example

#### Skeleton

The skeleton creates a very simple letter.  This shows the (complete) source on the left and the
rendered pdf on the right:

Several formatting defaults for font, fontsize, indentation are in use. See `help(linl)` for a 
complete list and default values.

#### Vignette

The vignette example is a little more featureful and shows how to include a letterhead on-demand, a
signature, and a few formatting settings.  All of these are driven by simple YAML headers as seen on
the left:

The vignette also contains the few lines of vignette metadata one would exclude from a normal
letter.
        
### Status

The package is fully working, and on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/).

### Usage 

As the package is on CRAN, you can use the standard 

```r
install.packages("linl")
```

to install it from CRAN, and then use as a Markdown template via RStudio, or use code such as

```r
library(rmarkdown)
draft("myletter.Rmd", template="pdf", package="linl", edit=FALSE)
render("myletter.Rmd")
```

to create a first draft of a new `myletter.Rmd`.        

Interim and test versions may also appear on the [ghrr drat repo](https://ghrr.github.io/drat/) from
which they can be installed via one additional line as in

```r
drat:::addRepo("ghrr")     # registers the ghrr drat repo
install.packages("linl")   # installs linl from ghrr
```

Once installed, the above code examples should work as expected.

### Requirements

Beyond the R package dependencies, a working `pandoc` binary is needed. RStudio installs
its own copy, otherwise do what is needed on your OS (_i.e._, something like `sudo apt-get
install pandoc pandoc-citeproc`).
